It contains two pages — a **Home page** that introduces me and a **Contact page** for visitors to reach out.

## 📄 Pages

* **Home:** Introduction about me and my portfolio overview.
* **Contact:** Page with my contact details or form for communication.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **HTML5** – for website structure
* **CSS3** – for styling and layout

## 🚀 How to View

You can view the live version of my portfolio here:
👉 [**Live Demo**](https://yourusername.github.io/your-repo-name/) *(replace with your actual link)*

Or clone the repository and open `index.html` in your browser:

cd your-repo-name
open index.html
```

Would you like me to make this sound a bit **more creative and eye-catching** (like something that stands out on GitHub)?
